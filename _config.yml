  I am a Computer Engineer who loves thinking about solutions for daily problems, especially computer ones. I have been experienced many fields in the computer world, such as software development, robotics and hardware design. My main focus is software development, specifically in the Android framework, but I have an open attitude about involving in other aspects of computer fields. Because having multi-dimensional thinking helps to overcome the problems more straightforward and in a reasonable time. 
  
  My personality type is INTJ, Iâ€™m eager to learn new things, and I have the spirit of working with small teams or alone.
